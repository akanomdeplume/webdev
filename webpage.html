    <h1>The stay tuned burger</h1>
    <body>There is a Burger from vegas, Its called the stay tuned burger. its from a bar off the strip. Its phenonimal, i think I gave it a 9.4 maybe a 9.3, which is unheard of levels for me, my highest was like a 9.6 in San antonio. Anyways its a really strange setup, you can go and order the burger and then give the burger.</body>
    <p>"Thats incredible! I'll really have to go try this burger!"</p>
