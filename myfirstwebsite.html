    <h1>Why I Love the Fender Jazzmaster</h1>
    <p>The Jazzmaster is an electric Guitar designed by fender in 1958, It was originally designed for Jazz players feature warm and heavy Single Coil "Soap Bar pickups" at the time they resembled the Gibsons P90 Pickups which was its competator, dispite being made for slower jazz playing it quickly gained the attention from the alternative music scene, Plays from genres like Alternate Rock, Shoegaze, Surf Rock, and indie rock all FELL in love with the functionality of the Fender jazzmaster, Its low range tremelo arm was also incredible for adding dymamics to songs, which Famous Guitarist 'Kevin Shields' from the shoegaze VAND "my bloody valentine" took advantage of by creating a new technique called "Glide Picking" in which the guitarist would gently hold and sway the guitars tremelo bar while strumming chords as stand, this created\\ a beautiful swaying or spiraling sound with the use of any effects pedals, this goes to show how dynamic the Jazzmaster can be.  </p>
